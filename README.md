# Malware Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive solution for malware analysis and prediction. It combines multiple dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), with state-of-the-art machine learning models, including RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks), DNN (Deep Neural Networks), SVM (Support Vector Machines), Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

The goal of this project is to provide a powerful and versatile platform for detecting and predicting malware in various contexts. It leverages dimensionality reduction to preprocess complex data and machine learning models to classify and predict malware, providing an all-encompassing solution for security professionals and researchers.

## Features

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: This project employs dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and LDA to reduce the complexity of data, making it more manageable for machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Models**: The project integrates several machine learning models, including RNN, DNN, SVM, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to classify and predict malware effectively.

- **Gradio User Interface**: For user-friendliness, this project includes a Gradio-based user interface. Gradio simplifies the interaction with the malware prediction model, allowing users to make predictions with ease.
